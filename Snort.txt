Here’s a simplified breakdown of the steps to demonstrate the **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using the **Snort** software:

### **What is Snort?**
- Snort is an open-source **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that helps monitor network traffic and detect potential security threats.
  
### **Steps for Configuring Snort IDS:**

1. **Download Snort**: 
   - Visit the Snort website (http://www.snort.org/snort-downloads) and download the Snort software. 
   - You will also need to download the **Snort rules** from https://www.snort.org/snort-rules. You must register to access these rules.

2. **Install Snort**:
   - Run the downloaded Snort installer (the `.exe` file). Snort will be installed in the `C:\Snort` folder.
   - **WinPcap** is also required for Snort to capture network traffic, so download and install it from https://www.winpcap.org/install/.

3. **Set Up the Rules**:
   - After downloading the Snort rules, extract them using a program like **WinRAR**.
   - Copy the contents of the **rules** folder and paste them into the `C:\Snort\rules` folder.

4. **Set Up the Configuration File**:
   - Locate the `snort.conf` file in the extracted folder and copy it into the `C:\Snort\etc` folder.
   - If you’re updating Snort and get a new `snort.conf` file, make sure to modify it to match your network environment.

5. **Find Your Network Interface**:
   - Open a command prompt and navigate to the Snort **bin** folder: `cd C:\Snort\bin`.
   - Run `snort -W` to list all network interfaces. Pick the interface number corresponding to your network card (usually it will say "Microsoft" or your network adapter name).

6. **Start Snort in Sniffer Mode**:
   - In the command prompt, run this command to start Snort in sniffer mode: 
     ```
     snort -dev -i 3
     ```
   - Here, `-i 3` is the interface number (you can replace `3` with the correct number for your network adapter).

7. **Configure Snort for IDS Mode**:
   - To enable IDS mode, you need to edit the `snort.conf` file.
   - Look for this line: `var HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24`. This defines your network's IP address range that Snort will monitor.
   - Change `HOME_NET` to match your network. For example, `192.168.0.0/24` for a local home network.

8. **Set Path to Rules Folder**:
   - In `snort.conf`, specify the correct path to your **rules** folder. It should look like:
     ```
     var RULE_PATH c:\snort\rules
     ```

9. **Modify Library File Paths**:
   - Update the path for library files in `snort.conf` to match where Snort is installed on your system (usually in `C:\Snort\lib`).
   
10. **Configure Dynamic Engine**:
    - In `snort.conf`, specify the path to the **dynamic engine**:
      ```
      dynamicengine C:\Snort\lib\snort_dynamicengine\sf_engine.dll
      ```

11. **Enable Logging**:
    - To save the alerts generated by Snort, find the `output log` section in `snort.conf` and add this line:
      ```
      output alert_fast: snort-alerts.ids
      ```

12. **Run Snort in IDS Mode**:
    - To start Snort in **IDS mode**, run:
      ```
      snort -c c:\snort\etc\snort.conf -l c:\snort\log -i 3
      ```
    - Here, `-c` specifies the configuration file, `-l` specifies the log location, and `-i 3` is the interface number.

13. **Log Files**:
    - When Snort runs in IDS mode, it will create log files in the specified folder (`C:\Snort\log`). You can use a program like **Notepad++** to view the log files.

14. **Scan the Computer with Ping or Nmap**:
    - Use a tool like **Ping** or **Nmap (ZenMap)** from another computer to simulate an attack and scan the computer running Snort.
    - Snort will detect these scans and log the results in the `snort-alerts.ids` file.

### **Final Result**:
Once everything is set up and running, Snort will monitor your network traffic, looking for any suspicious activities (like scans, unauthorized access attempts, etc.). If an intrusion or suspicious activity is detected, Snort will log an alert in the `snort-alerts.ids` file, which you can check for evidence of network attacks.

### **Conclusion**:
This setup demonstrates how Snort works as an IDS, identifying potential intrusions based on pre-configured rules and logging any detected threats for further analysis.
